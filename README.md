# RaspberryMPC
A Raspberry Pi music player that can be controlled over the internet. Uses mpd, mpc and a simple python server to host a website with controls. Meant to act as a sound system, kind of like Sonos.

The Raspberry Pi runs a minimal install of Raspbian Jessie. The only additions are mpd for playing music and mpc to control mpd. The Raspberry Pi is meant to run with just an internet connection and a set of speakers. Really it only needs to be connected to the local network for it to work. 
A python program is used to hosts a simple website with controlls to execute mpc commands on the Pi.
For now the program only plays music stored on the Pi itself.

This project is nowhere near finished, so feel free to suggest changes or features.
